# Efada Project

**Project Description:** "Efada" is an innovative platform that aims to provide an integrated service to analyze and understand medical reports and provide personalized health guidance using artificial intelligence. The platform focuses on simplifying the interpretation of complex medical data for users, helping them better understand their health condition by analyzing laboratory reports and providing medical recommendations based on the results of these analyses.

## Feature List:

- **Knowing the health status:** Efada enables you to know your health status by attaching your laboratory tests.

- **Explaining medical reports:** Providing a comprehensive medical dictionary where users can learn about medical terms, conditions and treatments mentioned in their reports.

- **Multilingualism:** Ifad provides the user with the freedom to choose between Arabic and English.

- **Multiple attachments:** Through Efada, you can attach different documents, images and files.

- **Medical recommendations:** Based on the results of the reports, we provide the user with medical advice.

- **Tracking reports and health history:** Allowing users to upload and store multiple medical reports over time, allowing them to track changes and improvements in their health status.

- **Predicting the patient's condition:** Based on the results of the report, we explain the expected symptoms.
