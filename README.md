# Efada Project

**Project Description:** "Efada" is an innovative platform that aims to provide an integrated service to analyze medical reports, understand them, and provide personalized health advice. Using artificial intelligence, the platform interprets complex medical data in a simplified and easy-to-understand manner, and provides instant alerts in case of health risks that require attention, with the availability of reliable medical personnel to answer your inquiries.

## Feature List:

- **Explaining medical reports:** Providing a comprehensive medical dictionary where users can learn about medical terms, conditions and treatments mentioned in their reports.

- **Multilingualism:** Ifad provides the user with the freedom to choose between Arabic and English.

- **Multiple attachments:** Through Efada, you can attach different documents, images and files.

- **Medical recommendations:** Based on the results of the reports, we provide the user with medical advice.

- **Providing a medical team:** Allowing users to share their reports directly with doctors to obtain medical notes.

- **Tracking reports and health history:** Allowing users to upload and store multiple medical reports over time, allowing them to track changes and improvements in their health status.

- **Predicting the patient's condition:** Based on the results of the report, we explain the expected symptoms.
